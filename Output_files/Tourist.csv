Monument,Melbourne City Council,Shrine Of Rememberance,144.9734889,-37.8305444," It commemorates the service and sacrifice of all Victorians who have served and died in wars since World War I (1914-18). It embodies the devastating impact of that war on the Australian nation, and Victoria in particular, which lost the largest proportion of its young men in the country. When the project was conceived, Melbourne was the capital of Australia and the seat of Federal Parliament and this resulted in the grandest war memorial in Australia, until the Australian War Memorial was built in Canberra in 1941. Since World War II (1939-45) numerous elements, including a commemorative forecourt, trees, statues and memorials, have been added to the Shrine Reserve to honour servicemen and women and peacekeepers from 1939 to the present day. As the largest and most important war memorial in Victoria, it reflects the community's ongoing need for a public expression of grief and of commemoration for the sacrifice of life in war.",vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/806,Melbourne City,"['Melbourne City Council', 'Melbourne City', 'Tourist Site']"
