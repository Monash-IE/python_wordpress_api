Park,Hobsons Bay City Council,Gray Reserve,144.889452,-37.8593399,"Named after Lieutenant General Leslie James Morshead

Leslie Morshead won fame as the defender of Tobruk during the Second World War and is among the most renowned Australian divisional commanders of that war. He was born at Ballarat in Victoria on 18 September 1889 and became a teacher. Joining the AIF in September 1914 as a lieutenant, Morshead was posted to the 2nd Battalion. 

By the time he landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 he was a captain; by August, when he fought at Lone Pine, he had been promoted to major. After Gallipoli he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 33rd Battalion, which arrived in France in November 1916. Morshead led the battalion successfully through Messines and the Passchendaele campaign of late-1917, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and continued to command through the battles Villers-Bretonneux and Amiens in 1918. 

Morshead joined General Monash's staff for the demobilisation of the AIF and returned to Sydney in December 1919. He married Myrtle Woodside in November 1921. Having failed to make a success of a soldier-settlers' block in Queensland, Morshead returned to Sydney to work in shipping, gaining promotions and posts in several Australian cities and in England. 

He remained active in the militia, commanding two battalions and reaching the rank of temporary brigadier. In October 1939 he was given command of the 18th Brigade, sailing for Britain in May 1940. The following February Morshead was promoted to major general in command of the 9th Division, then in the Middle East. Reputed to be a tough commander who could be blunt with senior officers, Morshead led his division through the siege of Tobruk where his aggressive defence denied the Germans a breakthrough but earned him the ire of some subordinates concerned at the level of losses. 

His success at Tobruk was followed by promotion to lieutenant general and command of the AIF in the Middle East. Morshead, at the risk of alienating his British superiors, argued to keep the 9th Division together in the face of British demands to detach individual brigades. He led the division through the battle of El Alamein, where the 9th Division's contribution was considered vital to the victory. During the battle, he regularly visited both the front and the wounded behind the lines. 

Returning to Australia in 1943, Morshead took command of II Corps in October and then in November was elevated to command both New Guinea Force and the Second Australian Army. In May 1944 he was given command of I Corps, leading them through the final battles of the war in Borneo. After the war, he chaired a military court of enquiry into Major General Bennett's departure from Singapore in February 1942. 

Morshead refused offers of military and diplomatic posts, as well as the governorship of Queensland, returning instead to the shipping industry as manager of the New South Wales branch of the Orient Line; later he became its Australian general manager. He held a number of other directorships and civil appointments and was involved in right-wing politics before becoming ill with cancer in the mid-1950s. Morshead died in Sydney on 26 September 1959.",https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/P10676535,Williamstown,"['Hobsons Bay City Council', 'Williamstown', 'Park']"

The balance payable over 5 years was raised by community fundraising efforts.
In 1957 the gates were given as a gift by Mrs Lillian Adams of Main Ridge.
On 28th April 1959 the Shire President was invited to unveil a plaque in memory of Frank Ditterich.  Frank was born in Long Gully, Bendigo on 17th September 1895 and died on 28th December 1956 at Mentone. He married his wife Jessie in 1930. They had two sons Richard and David.

Park,Mornington Peninsula Shire Council,Shaw Mckeown Reserve,144.9566496,-38.3439014,"This reserve is named in honour of two of Dromana's pioneering families: the Shaw family and the McKeown family.
<br>
<br>The Shaw family (Benjamin and Elizabeth) arrived in Dromana in 1875 and established Kangerong Guest House.  Their son Archibald Shaw married Maud McKeown, daughter of James and Catherine McKeown, and started the family connection.  Archibald was elected President of the Flinders Shire Council in 1924. Archibald and Maud raised and educated five children in Dromana (Maurice, Ernest, Archibald, Elizabeth and John).  Maurice was the long-term proprietor of the Shell Service Station in Dromana and Shaw's Motors on Nepean Highway for many years prior to his death in 1991 aged 87.  
<br>
<br>The McKeown family (James and Catherine) arrived in Dromana in 1864.  James cut timber for the Dromana pier in 1874 and in 1889 bought Gracefield and land to the East, where they planted an apple orchard.  That land covered the area on which the reserve is now located.  From 1889 to 1891 they were caretakers at Heronswood and in 1892 the McKeowns built Aringa Guest House (Cnr of Clarendon and Foote Streets Dromana) which was managed by their daughters for over 70 years until after the Second World War. James and Catherine raised 12 children (five sons and seven daughters); one daughter, Edith, the source for the naming of Edith Place, died in Dromana in 1987 aged 100. Two further generations of the Shaw and McKeown families have since lived in Dromana.
<br>
<br>The surrounding land and the land on which the reserve is located was subdivided by the descendants of the pioneering Shaws and McKeowns in 1977 and the reserve was transferred to the Shire of Flinders (and since Mornington Peninsula Shire) for use as public open space.",,Dromana,"['Mornington Peninsula Shire Council', 'Dromana', 'Park']"

She had continued this work on her return to England, and had encouraged poor people, especially young women, to leave the squalor of their homeland and emigrate to Australia. Her work in Victoria was in providing clean, cheap and safe accommodation to families or single people on the way to the Mount Alexander diggings. She pressured the government into a scheme to built ten shelter sheds, which would provide accommodation for single men, single women and families. While none of the sheds lasted, the park is in the rough area where the sheds were located. ",,Keilor Park,"['Brimbank City Council', 'Keilor Park', 'Park']"

Park,Kingston City Council,Harold Caterson Reserve,145.069634,-37.9506251,"Harold Caterson was a member of Moorabbin Rugby Union Football Club's first committee, he was at the initial meeting in December 1964 that agreed to create a rugby club in Moorabbin to commence in season 1965. He was a long-term committee member (in various positions) and club member in the 60s, 70s and 80s and he was key in establishing a home for Moorabbin at Keys. Rd. Additionally, he was involved on the Management Committee of the Victorian Rugby Union over many years.
In the history of the club Harold Caterson and Jack McDavitt stand out as the two most influential club members who founded, developed and built Moorabbin Rugby Club from scratch.
Jack has, appropriately, had the extended clubrooms (originally built in 1978) named in his honour for his contribution to the club. The reserve was renamed in honour of Harold's contribution to the club.

Keys Rd ground was an old rubbish tip that had been filled and covered in a layer of soil. The surface was continually subsiding, in 1965 junior cricket was played on this ground and the oval was found unsuitable for cricket; it was actually a muddy paddock in winter and a corrugated concrete oval in summer. Cricket never returned to this oval.
Harold could see the potential in the Keys Rd Reserve and in 1967 donated the cost of a single car steel garage placed on a concrete slab, which was to become our first changing room/clubroom, and was later known as ""the old tin shed"". It had the nickname of ""Mr. Cat's Cottage"" on a sign above the door.
The following year a small extension was added that held a briquette hot water service and several showers.
As the Club grew over the years, Harold continued to be a committee member and also continued to liaise with Council regarding club matters. Whether it was gaining approval for further extensions to the shed (there were several extensions over the years), ground improvements, a second playing field, flood lighting and eventually Clubrooms were built in 1978.
Harold was the ""go to person"" in regard to Council. He developed a very good relationship with Mayor Bricker, who later became our Patron for many years and over time became one of the Rams strongest supporters.
Gaining significant funding for a sport that was practically unknown in the district, was not easy. The relationship between Harold and Cr. Bricker proved vital on several occasions as the councillor supported funding for the club which otherwise might not have been approved.
That the Rams are based at Keys Road can be put down to Harold's dedication to securing a permanent home for rugby union in Moorabbin.

The club's playing jersey is also a legacy from Harold Caterson's U18 Marlins team.
He was President in 1968 and 1971; Vice President in 1969, 1970 and from 1972 to 1981 inclusive. Ordinary Committee Member 1965 to 1967.
Harold was made a Life Member in 1977.
Additionally, he was the Moorabbin club delegate to the Victorian Rugby Union for many years; and he would collate the results and statistics for the VRU weekly magazine each week during the season.
His work with the club, Council and the VRU continued right up to his sudden death in 1981.
It is worth noting that four generations of the Caterson family have been involved in playing and administrating the Moorabbin Rugby Club since its inception in 1965.",,Moorabbin,"['Kingston City Council', 'Moorabbin', 'Park']"
