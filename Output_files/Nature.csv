"Harold Caterson was a member of Moorabbin Rugby Union Football Club's first committee, he was at the initial meeting in December 1964 that agreed to create a rugby club in Moorabbin to commence in season 1965. He was a long-term committee member (in various positions) and club member in the 60s, 70s and 80s and he was key in establishing a home for Moorabbin at Keys. Rd. Additionally, he was involved on the Management Committee of the Victorian Rugby Union over many years.
In the history of the club Harold Caterson and Jack McDavitt stand out as the two most influential club members who founded, developed and built Moorabbin Rugby Club from scratch.
Jack has, appropriately, had the extended clubrooms (originally built in 1978) named in his honour for his contribution to the club. The reserve was renamed in honour of Harold's contribution to the club.

Keys Rd ground was an old rubbish tip that had been filled and covered in a layer of soil. The surface was continually subsiding, in 1965 junior cricket was played on this ground and the oval was found unsuitable for cricket; it was actually a muddy paddock in winter and a corrugated concrete oval in summer. Cricket never returned to this oval.
Harold could see the potential in the Keys Rd Reserve and in 1967 donated the cost of a single car steel garage placed on a concrete slab, which was to become our first changing room/clubroom, and was later known as ""the old tin shed"". It had the nickname of ""Mr. Cat's Cottage"" on a sign above the door.
The following year a small extension was added that held a briquette hot water service and several showers.
As the Club grew over the years, Harold continued to be a committee member and also continued to liaise with Council regarding club matters. Whether it was gaining approval for further extensions to the shed (there were several extensions over the years), ground improvements, a second playing field, flood lighting and eventually Clubrooms were built in 1978.
Harold was the ""go to person"" in regard to Council. He developed a very good relationship with Mayor Bricker, who later became our Patron for many years and over time became one of the Rams strongest supporters.
Gaining significant funding for a sport that was practically unknown in the district, was not easy. The relationship between Harold and Cr. Bricker proved vital on several occasions as the councillor supported funding for the club which otherwise might not have been approved.
That the Rams are based at Keys Road can be put down to Harold's dedication to securing a permanent home for rugby union in Moorabbin.

The club's playing jersey is also a legacy from Harold Caterson's U18 Marlins team.
He was President in 1968 and 1971; Vice President in 1969, 1970 and from 1972 to 1981 inclusive. Ordinary Committee Member 1965 to 1967.
Harold was made a Life Member in 1977.
Additionally, he was the Moorabbin club delegate to the Victorian Rugby Union for many years; and he would collate the results and statistics for the VRU weekly magazine each week during the season.
His work with the club, Council and the VRU continued right up to his sudden death in 1981.
It is worth noting that four generations of the Caterson family have been involved in playing and administrating the Moorabbin Rugby Club since its inception in 1965.",-37.950625099999996,145.069634,Kingston City,Harold Caterson Reserve,,['Park']

"''The Hayes Reserve' after early pioneers of this area.  Mark Hayes selected the land at Tooborac in August 1857 and the family lived in tenets on a little creek on the east side of the road (which is now the reserve in question) until the stone house 'Leicester House' was built.  This was finished and occupied by 1862.  The House was continuously lived in by members of the Hayes family, until the property was sold in the 1970's.  The ship Mark and his family arrived in Australia aboard was the 'Harry Lorrequest', which sailed from Plymouth 27th November, 1850.
